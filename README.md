### It is recommended that you read the official document first

kraken docs [https://www.kraken.live/api](https://www.kraken.live/api)

All interface methods are initialized the same as those provided by kraken. See details [src/api](https://github.com/zhouaini528/kraken-php/tree/master/src/Api)

Most of the interface is now complete, and the user can continue to extend it based on my design, working with me to improve it.
